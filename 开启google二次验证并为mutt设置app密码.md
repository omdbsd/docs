## enable Google 2-step verification and using an app-specific password for mutt.

More detail:

I enabled 2-step verification on my Google account, which means that when I log in to Google, I have to enter a pin number from either a text or from the Google Authenticator app.

Then I had to get an app-specific password for mutt. You can generate an app specific password [here](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords).

Then I used that app-specific password for logging into mutt instead of my normal password. And then I don't have to enter a pin number.
